error::buildid - build-id verification failures

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<P>
Because systemtap's script translation / execution stages may be
executed at different times and places, it is sometimes necessary to
verify certain invariants.  One such invariant is that if a script
was informed by translate-time analysis of executables, then those
same executables need to be used at run time.  This checking
is done based upon the build-id, a binary hash that modern (post-2007)
compilers/toolchains add as an 
<I>NT_GNU_BUILD_ID</I>

ELF note to object files and executables.
Use the
<I>readelf -n</I>

command to examine the build-ids of binaries, if you are interested.
<P>
<P>

<P>
Only scripts are sensitive to executables' build-ids: generally those
that perform deep analysis of the binaries or their debuginfo.  For example,
scripts that place
<I>.function</I> or <I>.statement</I>

probes, or use stack backtrace-related tapset functions may be sensitive.
Other scripts that rely only on
<I>process.mark</I> or <I>kernel.trace</I>

probes do not require debuginfo.  See the DWARF DEBUGINFO section in the
<I><A HREF="stapprobes.3stap.html">stapprobes</A></I>(3stap)

man page.

<P>
During translation, systemtap saves a copy of the relevant files'
build-ids within the compiled modules.  At run-time, the modules
compare the saved ones to the actual run-time build-ids in memory.
The error message indicates that they did not match, so the module
will decline placing a probe that was computed based upon obsolete
data.  This is important for safety, as placing them at an
inappropriate address could crash the programs.  However, this is not
necessarily a fatal error, since probes unrelated to the mismatching
binaries may operate.
<P>
<P>

<P>
A build-id mismatch could be caused by a few different situations.
The main one is where the executable versions or architecture were
different between the systemtap translation and execution
times/places.  For example, one may run a stap-server on a slightly
different version of the OS distribution.  Someone may have rebuilt a
new kernel image, but preserved the previous version numbers.  The
kernel running on the workstation may be slightly different from the
version being targeted - perhaps due to a pending kernel upgrade
leaving different files on disk versus running in memory.  If your OS
distribution uses separate debuginfo packages, the split <I>.debug</I>
files may not exactly match the main binaries.

<P>
To disable build-id verification errors, if one is confident that they
are an artefact of build accidents rather than a real mismatch, one
might try the
<I>-DSTP_NO_BUILDID_CHECK</I>

option.
